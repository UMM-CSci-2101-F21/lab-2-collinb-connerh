This code was created for use in CSci 2101: Data Structures at the University of Minnesota Morris.

By the end of this lab, students should:
   * Be able to work with another student to complete a lab (each taking turns writing code or navigating)
   * Know how to give credit to another author on GitHub appropriately in the git commit message
   * Understand how to implement a data structure to make tests pass
   * Understand how the linked list data structure works


The [instructions for this lab](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10IimV5DAlpOsXKifW8_iVSqmULCq88WsWP7D7oXBXsA/edit?usp=sharing) are written in a Google Doc accessible for viewing by anyone with the link.
